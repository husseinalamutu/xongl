- I created a Golang app using Echo framework to convert rupees to dollars. It makes use of Rest APIs and http requests.
- I created a route "/convert"  with GET data to make request to the currency converter api for the currency conversion result.
- The response is in USD ( convert the currency value from rupees to dollars)
- I used https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/ for the currency conversion api
